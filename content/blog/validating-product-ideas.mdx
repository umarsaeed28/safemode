Everyone says you should validate before you build. Few people say what that actually means at each stage. Validation is not one thing. It is a set of questions you answer with the cheapest signal that is good enough. Here is how to do it without wasting time or building on sand.

## The Validation Ladder

**Problem validation.** Do people have this problem? Are they already trying to solve it in some way? You answer this with interviews and observation. You do not need a product. You need to hear people describe the problem in their own words and see what they do today. If you cannot find evidence that the problem is real and felt, stop. Do not build.

**Solution validation.** Would they use something that solved it? You can test this with a concept test (describe the solution, gauge reaction), a prototype (click through a flow), or a concierge or Wizard of Oz version (you do the work behind the scenes). The goal is to see if the solution resonates and if people would take the action you care about (sign up, pay, use). You still do not need to build the full product.

**Product validation.** Do they use it when it is real? This is the stage where you build and ship. You measure behavior: activation, retention, usage. The MVP or the first real release is the validation. If they do not use it, you have learned. Pivot or kill.

**Scale validation.** Can you grow without burning out? This is later: distribution, unit economics, repeatability. Different set of experiments.

Most teams skip problem and solution validation and go straight to building. Then they wonder why launch fell flat. Do the steps in order. Use the cheapest test that gives you enough signal.

## How to Choose the Test

Match the test to the risk. If the risk is "no one has this problem," you need conversations. If the risk is "they have the problem but would not use our solution," you need a concept or prototype test. If the risk is "they would try it but would not stick," you need a real product and usage data.

Do not use a survey when you need behavior. Do not use a prototype when you need to test willingness to pay (sometimes you need a real price and a real ask). Do not build the full product when a prototype would answer the question.

## When to Stop Validating

When you have enough signal to make the next decision. That might be five interviews. It might be 50 signups on a waitlist. It might be a prototype test with eight users. The bar is: would you bet on this? If yes, move to the next stage. If no, kill or pivot. Do not keep validating in circles. At some point you have to build or quit.

## The Bottom Line

Validation is a ladder: problem, solution, product, scale. Use the right test at each stage. Use the cheapest test that gives you enough signal. And know when you have enough to decide. Then build or stop.
