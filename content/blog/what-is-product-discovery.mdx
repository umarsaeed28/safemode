Product discovery is the work you do before you commit to building. It is not "gathering requirements." It is not "writing user stories." It is the structured effort to reduce uncertainty about what to build and whether it will work before you spend engineering time on it.

Most teams skip it. They have a roadmap, a backlog, or a founder's vision, and they go straight to design and development. The cost shows up later: features that don't move the needle, rework, and the slow realization that the problem was never clearly defined.

## Why Discovery Gets Skipped

Three reasons show up again and again.

**Pressure to ship.** Stakeholders want to see progress. Code and screens feel like progress. Research and synthesis feel like delay. So discovery gets cut or done in a shallow way.

**Confusion with "design."** Discovery is often folded into a design phase that is really about making things look good. Real discovery answers: Is this the right problem? Is this the right solution? Would anyone use it?

**No one owns it.** Product owns the roadmap. Design owns the screens. Engineering owns the build. Who owns "should we build this at all?" If the answer is unclear, discovery does not happen.

## What Discovery Actually Is

Discovery is a set of activities, not a single workshop or document.

- **Problem framing:** Stating the problem clearly, for whom, and why it matters now.
- **Evidence gathering:** Talking to users, looking at data, reviewing what already exists.
- **Synthesis:** Turning what you learned into a small set of claims and open questions.
- **Concepts and validation:** Sketching possible solutions and testing them in the lightest way possible (prototypes, landing pages, concierge tests).

The output of discovery is not a PRD. It is clarity. Clarity on the problem, the user, the opportunity, and the biggest risks. With that, you can make a go/no-go decision and, if go, scope the first thing to build with confidence.

## How Much Discovery Is Enough

Enough to reduce the risk you care about. If the risk is "will anyone use this?", you need some contact with real users. If the risk is "can we build it?", you need a technical spike or proof of concept. If the risk is "will this move the metric?", you need a clear hypothesis and a way to test it.

Discovery is not infinite. It has a scope and an end. Define the open questions, run the smallest set of activities that can answer them, then decide. Teams that treat discovery as a phase with a deadline make better decisions than teams that either skip it or let it drag.

## The Bottom Line

If you are a founder or product leader, the question is not whether you have time for discovery. It is whether you can afford to build the wrong thing. Product discovery is the insurance you buy before you build. Do the work.
