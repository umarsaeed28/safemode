A backlog is supposed to be a list of work you might do. In practice it becomes a graveyard of ideas that will never ship and tickets that no one can explain. That is not a backlog. That is clutter. Here is how to fix it.

## Why Backlogs Rot

**Everything goes in, nothing comes out.** Every request, every "we should do this someday," every half-baked idea gets a ticket. No one ever removes anything. The backlog grows into the hundreds or thousands. At that size it is useless. No one can reason about it. Prioritization becomes theater.

**No one owns the clean-up.** Product owns the roadmap. Engineering owns the sprint. Who owns the backlog? If the answer is unclear, no one trims. The backlog becomes a dumping ground.

**Context is lost.** A ticket from six months ago might have made sense then. The world changed. The ticket stays. When someone finally looks at it, they cannot tell if it is still relevant. So they leave it. The backlog fills with zombies.

## How to Clean a Backlog

**Archive by default.** Move everything that is not a real candidate for the next two quarters into an "archive" or "backlog park." Do not delete. Archive. You can always pull something back. The active backlog should be short enough to read and reason about. Fifty to a hundred items is already a lot. If you have more, you are not maintaining a backlog; you are hoarding.

**Kill explicitly.** Some ideas are not worth keeping. They were wrong, or the moment passed. Mark them as "won't do" or "obsolete" and move on. Document why in one line. That way when someone asks "what about X?" you have an answer.

**Refresh the rest.** For what remains, ensure each item has a clear title, a sentence on why it matters, and a rough size or confidence. If it does not, either fix it or archive it. A backlog item no one can explain is noise.

## How to Keep It Healthy

**Limit what gets in.** Not every idea gets a ticket. Ideas get discussed. If they are worth considering, they get a ticket. If they are "someday maybe," they go in a separate list or a doc. The backlog is for real candidates, not dreams.

**Review regularly.** Once a quarter, or at least twice a year, go through the backlog. Archive what is no longer relevant. Promote what became important. This is not prioritization. This is hygiene.

**One source of truth.** If you have a roadmap, the backlog should feed it. If you have a sprint, the backlog should feed that. Do not maintain three lists that are supposed to be the same thing. One backlog. One place to look.

## The Bottom Line

A healthy backlog is short, current, and explainable. Archive the rest. Kill what is obsolete. Review on a schedule. And stop putting everything in. A backlog that never gets trimmed is a backlog that no one will use.
