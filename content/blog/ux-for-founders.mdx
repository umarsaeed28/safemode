If you are a founder, you will hire designers and maybe product people. You will not hire your way out of understanding users and how your product fits their lives. You need enough UX literacy to set direction, evaluate work, and know when something is wrong. Here is what that means in practice.

## What You Need to Understand

**The difference between discovery and delivery.** Discovery is the work of understanding the problem and testing solutions before you build. Delivery is the work of designing and building the thing. Both matter. Many teams only do delivery. They skip discovery and wonder why the product does not resonate. You do not need to run every interview. You need to know that discovery exists and that someone is doing it.

**What good research looks like.** You do not need to be a researcher. You need to know the basics: ask about behavior and the past, not preferences and the future. Synthesize into a small set of insights. Use those to inform what you build. If your team is doing "research" that is really a survey of "would you use this?" you are not learning. You are collecting opinions.

**What good design looks like.** Good design is not just how it looks. It is whether the flow makes sense, whether the hierarchy supports the task, whether the product is learnable and consistent. You do not need to do the design. You need to be able to say "this flow is confusing" or "we are missing the main action" and be right. That comes from using the product and from watching users use it.

## What to Hire For

When you hire your first design or product person, hire for discovery and structure, not just pixels. You need someone who can frame problems, run lightweight research, and turn ambiguity into a clear direction. A person who only makes pretty screens will leave you with pretty screens and the same uncertainty.

Look for someone who can say no. The best product and UX people will push back on scope, on features, on building before learning. That is the behavior you want. You already have enough people who say yes to everything.

## How to Stay Involved

Do not disappear into strategy and leave "the product stuff" to the team. Stay close to the user. Sit in on at least some interviews or watch the recordings. Review synthesis and concepts before they become specs. You do not need to run the process. You need to see the evidence and the reasoning. That is how you keep product sense and how you catch misalignment early.

## The Bottom Line

You cannot outsource product sense. You can hire people who are better at discovery and design than you. To lead them and to judge the work, you need to understand what discovery is, what good research and design look like, and how to stay close to the user. Get that right, and the rest gets easier.
