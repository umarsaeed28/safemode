Minimum viable product is one of the most misused ideas in product. Some use it to justify shipping something half-baked. Others use it to avoid building anything until they have "validated" with another round of interviews. The concept is sound. The execution is usually wrong.

## What MVP Actually Means

An MVP is the smallest thing you can build that lets you learn whether you are on the right track. The key word is learn. It is not the smallest thing you can ship. It is not the first version of the product you will scale. It is the smallest experiment that produces a signal you care about.

That signal might be: will anyone use it? Will they pay? Does it solve the problem well enough to create retention? The MVP is shaped by the question, not by a generic "keep it small" rule.

## The Two Main Mistakes

**Building too much.** Teams pack the first release with features because stakeholders cannot let go. The result is slow to build and hard to interpret. When it fails, you do not know which part was wrong. An MVP should have so few elements that you can point to one or two and say: we tested this. This is what we learned.

**Building too little.** The opposite error is building something so minimal that it cannot possibly produce a real signal. A landing page with a signup form tells you about interest, not behavior. A prototype that does not actually solve the problem tells you nothing about whether the solution works. Viability has a floor. Below it, you are not testing a product; you are testing a concept. That is valid, but call it what it is.

## How to Scope an MVP

Start with the risk you need to reduce. If the risk is demand, your MVP might be a waitlist or a concierge version. If the risk is solution fit, your MVP needs to deliver the core outcome in a narrow scenario. If the risk is technical, your MVP might be a spike or a prototype that proves the hard part works.

Define the one or two learning goals. Then remove everything that does not serve them. What is left is your MVP. It will feel too small. That is the point.

## After the MVP

An MVP is not version 1.0. It is an experiment. When you get the signal, you decide: pivot, persevere, or kill. If you persevere, you then scope the first real release based on what you learned. That release might still be "minimal" in the sense of focused, but it is no longer an experiment. It is a product you are committing to.

Do not let the word "minimum" become an excuse for bad quality in the areas that matter. The MVP should be minimal in scope, not minimal in craft for the scope you chose.

## The Bottom Line

MVP is the smallest build that generates the learning you need. Match the scope to the question. Do not pack it. Do not strip it so far that it cannot answer the question. Ship it, learn, then decide what comes next.
