A design sprint is a time-boxed process: understand the problem, sketch solutions, decide on one, build a prototype, test with users. Done right, it can replace weeks of back-and-forth with a few days of focus. Done wrong, it is an expensive workshop that produces a prototype nobody uses. The difference is in the setup and the follow-through.

## When a Design Sprint Makes Sense

**You have a bounded problem.** The sprint works when the question is clear: "Can we help users do X?" or "Will this flow work for this segment?" It does not work when the problem is "figure out what to build" with no constraints. Give the sprint a target. Otherwise you will spend five days going in circles.

**You have real users to test with.** The last day is test day. If you cannot get five or so people who match your target user in the room (or on a call), do not run the sprint. The value is in the feedback. No test, no learning.

**You have a decider.** Someone in the room must be able to make the final call on the concept. If everyone is a stakeholder with a veto, you will compromise into mush or stall. The decider does not have to be the CEO. They have to be the person who can say "we are building this" and have it stick.

## When to Skip a Design Sprint

**The problem is not yet framed.** If the team does not agree on the problem or the user, a sprint will not fix it. Do the framing first. Then consider a sprint to explore solutions.

**You are past the concept stage.** Sprints are for testing a concept or a flow. If you already have a product and you are iterating, you do not need a five-day sprint. You need ongoing discovery and small experiments.

**You cannot commit the right people.** A sprint needs the decider, the designer, the person who knows the user, and often someone who can build. If key people are in and out or distracted, the output will be weak. Do not run a sprint with a B-team.

## How to Run It Without the Theater

**Keep the scope tight.** One big question. One prototype. One user test. Do not try to solve three problems in one sprint.

**Prototype only what you need to test.** The prototype does not have to be high fidelity. It has to be good enough that a user can react to the concept. Paper or a clickable Figma flow is often enough. Do not gold-plate it.

**Use the output.** The sprint produces a tested concept and a pile of insights. If you do not have a plan to use them (to build the thing, to kill the thing, or to run a follow-up experiment), the sprint was a one-off event. Decide before you start what happens after. Otherwise you are running a workshop, not a sprint.

## The Bottom Line

Design sprints are a tool. Use them when you have a clear problem, access to users, and a decider. Skip them when the problem is fuzzy or you are past the concept stage. And always connect the sprint to a next step. Otherwise it is just theater.
