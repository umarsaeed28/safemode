User interviews are the backbone of product discovery. Done well, they reveal how people actually behave and what they actually need. Done poorly, they produce polite opinions and false confidence. The difference is in how you ask and what you listen for.

## The Mistake Most Teams Make

They ask people what they want. "Would you use a feature that did X?" "How would you prefer we solve Y?" Users are not designers. They will give you answers. Those answers will be sincere and mostly useless. Preferences stated in a room are not the same as behavior in the wild.

The goal of an interview is not to collect feature requests. It is to understand the context in which your product will live: the current workflow, the workarounds, the frustrations that show up in behavior, not in a survey.

## What to Ask Instead

Focus on the past and the concrete.

- "Tell me about the last time you had to do [relevant task]." You get a story, not a wish list.
- "What did you do step by step?" You get behavior, not opinion.
- "Where did it get stuck or annoying?" You get real pain points.
- "What did you use instead?" You get the real alternatives and the bar you have to clear.

Avoid hypotheticals. Avoid "would you" and "do you prefer." Push for specific examples. If they say "sometimes we have trouble with X," ask for the last time. Make it real.

## Who to Talk To

Talk to people who are in the problem space. Not "people who might use our product," but people who today are doing the job or solving the problem in some way. That might mean current users, churned users, or people who have never heard of you but do the thing you care about.

Recruiting is hard. You need a clear screener: what role, what behavior, what context. Skip people who cannot name a recent example. They will fill the hour with abstractions.

## How Many Interviews

Enough to hear the same themes. That is often five to eight per segment. If after five you are still hearing new, unrelated problems, you may have a segment problem or a focus problem. Tighten the screener or the question you are trying to answer.

Do not aim for statistical significance. Qualitative research is about depth and pattern, not percentages.

## Synthesize Before You Build

Interviews produce a lot of raw material. The value is in synthesis. Group what you heard. Label the patterns. Separate "one person said" from "we heard this repeatedly." The output should be a small set of insights and open questions, not a 50-slide deck of quotes.

Then use that to shape what you build. The interview is not the deliverable. The decision it informs is.

## The Bottom Line

User interviews work when you treat them as a way to learn behavior and context, not as a way to collect opinions. Ask about the past. Get specific. Synthesize. Then build.
