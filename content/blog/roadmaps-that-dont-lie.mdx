A roadmap is supposed to align the team and stakeholders on where the product is going. Too often it becomes a promise list that nobody believes and everyone pretends to. Dates slip. Priorities change. The roadmap becomes a lie. Here is how to fix it.

## Why Roadmaps Become Fiction

**They commit too early.** A roadmap that names specific features and dates is a commitment. Commitments are good when you have high confidence. Most of the time you do not. So the roadmap becomes a guess that gets treated as a promise. When reality diverges, the roadmap is wrong and trust erodes.

**They mix horizons.** Near-term work (this quarter) is knowable. Long-term direction (this year, or "the vision") is a bet. When you put both on the same grid with the same visual weight, people treat the long-term stuff as if it were committed. It is not. It is a hypothesis.

**They hide the real logic.** A good roadmap is driven by goals and outcomes. "We are doing X because we need to achieve Y." Many roadmaps are just a list of stuff. Without the why, stakeholders cannot tell what is fixed and what is flexible. They assume everything is fixed.

## What an Honest Roadmap Looks Like

**Near term: outcomes and themes.** For the current quarter, show what you are trying to achieve and the themes of work (e.g. "onboard faster," "reduce support load"). You can name a few concrete initiatives. Avoid listing every story. Avoid dates for individual items unless they are hard deadlines. The message is: we are working on this. Here is the outcome we are chasing.

**Mid term: direction, not schedule.** For the next quarter or two, show direction. "We will focus on X and Y. We will not do Z yet." Do not put months on mid-term items. Do not treat them as committed. They are the plan until they are not.

**Long term: vision and bets.** A year out, the roadmap is a narrative. "We believe the market will move here. We are betting on this. We will learn and adjust." No one should be scheduling resources off the year view. It is there to show direction and to start conversations.

## How to Present It

Separate the sections visually. Call the near term "committed" or "in progress" and the rest "direction" or "exploratory." In the meeting, say the words: "Only the first section is what we are committed to. The rest is our current thinking and will change."

Update the roadmap when priorities change. Do not wait for the next planning cycle. A roadmap that does not change when the world changes is a lie. The goal is not to stick to the plan. It is to have a plan that reflects reality and to change it when reality does.

## The Bottom Line

A roadmap is useful when it separates commitment from direction and when it is updated when things change. Keep the near term concrete and outcome-focused. Keep the rest honest about uncertainty. And never let the roadmap become a promise you cannot keep.
